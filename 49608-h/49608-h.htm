<h3>THE DEATH OF CUCHULAIN</h3>

<div class="verse"><span class="smcap">A man</span> came slowly from the setting sun,</div>
<div class="verse">To Forgail’s daughter, Emer, in her dun,</div>
<div class="verse">And found her dyeing cloth with subtle care,</div>
<div class="verse">And said, casting aside his draggled hair:</div>
<div class="verse">‘I am Aleel, the swineherd, whom you bid</div>
<div class="verse">Go dwell upon the sea cliffs, vapour-hid;</div>
<div class="verse">But now my years of watching are no more.’</div>
    </div>
    <div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Then Emer cast the web upon the floor,</div>

    </div>
    <div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Looking on her, Aleel, the swineherd, said:</div>

<div class="verse">And where her son, Finmole, on the smooth grass</div>
<div class="verse">Was driving cattle, came she with swift feet,</div>

    </div>
    <div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">After short fighting in the leafy shade,</div>
<div class="verse">He spake to the young man, ‘Is there no maid</div>
<div class="verse">Who loves you, no white arms to wrap you round,</div>
<div class="verse">Or do you long for the dim sleepy ground,</div>
<div class="verse">That you come here to meet this ancient sword?’</div>

    </div>
    <div class="stanza">
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 10em;">Again the fighting sped,</span></div>
<div class="verse">But now the war rage in Cuchulain woke,</div>
<div class="verse">And through the other’s shield his long blade broke,</div>
<div class="verse">And pierced him.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="stanza">
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 4em;">‘Speak before your breath is done.’</span></div>

    <div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">While day its burden on to evening bore,</div>
<div class="verse">With head bowed on his knees Cuchulain stayed;</div>
<div class="verse">Then Conchubar sent that sweet-throated maid,</div>
<div class="verse">And she, to win him, his gray hair caressed;</div>
<div class="verse">In vain her arms, in vain her soft white breast.</div>
<div class="verse">Then Conchubar, the subtlest of all men,</div>
<div class="verse">Ranking his Druids round him ten by ten,</div>
<div class="verse">Spake thus, ‘Cuchulain will dwell there and brood</div>
<div class="verse">For three days more in dreadful quietude,</div>
<div class="verse">And then arise, and raving slay us all.</div>
<div class="verse">Go, cast on him delusions magical,</div>
<div class="verse">That he may fight the waves of the loud sea.’</div>
<div class="verse">And ten by ten under a quicken tree,</div>
<div class="verse">The Druids chaunted, swaying in their hands</div>
<div class="verse">Tall wands of alder and white quicken wands.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">In three days’ time, Cuchulain with a moan</div>
<div class="verse">Stood up, and came to the long sands alone:</div>
<div class="verse">For four days warred he with the bitter tide;</div>
<div class="verse">And the waves flowed above him, and he died.</div>

<div class="verse">On! on! and now a hornless deer</div>

<div class="verse">The floor of Emen’s hosting hall</div>
<div class="verse"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>Was not more level than the sea,</div>
<div class="verse">As full of loving phantasy,</div>
<div class="verse">And with low murmurs we rode on,</div>
<div class="verse">Where many a trumpet-twisted shell</div>
<div class="verse">That in immortal silence sleeps</div>
<div class="verse">Dreaming of her own melting hues,</div>
<div class="verse">Her golds, her ambers, and her blues,</div>

<div class="verse">But now a wandering land breeze came</div>
<div class="verse">And a far sound of feathery quires;</div>

<div class="verse">They seemed to sing in the smouldering fires.</div>
<div class="verse">The horse towards the music raced,</div>
<div class="verse">Neighing along the lifeless waste;</div>
<div class="verse">Like sooty fingers, many a tree</div>
<div class="verse">Rose ever out of the warm sea;</div>
<div class="verse">And they were trembling ceaselessly,</div>

<div class="verse">We cantered to the shore, and knew</div>
<div class="verse">The reason of the trembling trees:</div>
<div class="verse">Round every branch the song-birds flew,</div>
<div class="verse">Or clung thereon like swarming bees;</div>
<div class="verse">While round the shore a million stood</div>
<div class="verse">Like drops of frozen rainbow light,</div>
<div class="verse">And pondered in a soft vain mood,</div>
<div class="verse"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>Upon their shadows in the tide,</div>
<div class="verse">And told the purple deeps their pride,</div>
<div class="verse">And murmured snatches of delight;</div>
<div class="verse">And on the shores were many boats</div>
<div class="verse">With bending sterns and bending bows,</div>
<div class="verse">And carven figures on their prows</div>
<div class="verse">Of bitterns, and fish-eating stoats,</div>
<div class="verse">And swans with their exultant throats:</div>
<div class="verse">And where the wood and waters meet</div>
<div class="verse">We tied the horse in a leafy clump,</div>
<div class="verse">And Niamh blew three merry notes</div>
<div class="verse">Out of a little silver trump;</div>
<div class="verse">And then an answering whisper flew</div>
<div class="verse">Over the bare and woody land,</div>
<div class="verse">A whisper of impetuous feet,</div>
<div class="verse">And ever nearer, nearer grew;</div>
<div class="verse">And from the woods rushed out a band</div>
<div class="verse">Of men and maidens, hand in hand,</div>
<div class="verse">And singing, singing altogether;</div>
<div class="verse">Their brows were white as fragrant milk,</div>
<div class="verse">Their cloaks made out of yellow silk,</div>
<div class="verse">And trimmed with many a crimson feather:</div>
<div class="verse">And when they saw the cloak I wore</div>
<div class="verse">Was dim with mire of a mortal shore,</div>
<div class="verse">They fingered it and gazed on me</div>
<div class="verse">And laughed like murmurs of the sea;</div>
<div class="verse">But Niamh with a swift distress</div>
<div class="verse">Bid them away and hold their peace;</div>
<div class="verse"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>And when they heard her voice they ran</div>
<div class="verse">And knelt them, every maid and man,</div>
<div class="verse">And kissed, as they would never cease,</div>
<div class="verse">Her pearl-pale hand and the hem of her dress.</div>
<div class="verse">She bade them bring us to the hall</div>
<div class="verse">Where Aengus dreams, from sun to sun,</div>
<div class="verse">A Druid dream of the end of days</div>
<div class="verse">When the stars are to wane and the world be done.</div>

    <div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">They led us by long and shadowy ways</div>
<div class="verse">Where drops of dew in myriads fall,</div>
<div class="verse">And tangled creepers every hour</div>
<div class="verse">Blossom in some new crimson flower,</div>
<div class="verse">And once a sudden laughter sprang</div>
<div class="verse">From all their lips, and once they sang</div>
<div class="verse">Together, while the dark woods rang,</div>
<div class="verse">And made in all their distant parts,</div>
<div class="verse">With boom of bees in honey marts,</div>
<div class="verse">A rumour of delighted hearts.</div>
<div class="verse">And once a maiden by my side</div>
<div class="verse">Gave me a harp, and bid me sing,</div>
<div class="verse">And touch the laughing silver string;</div>
<div class="verse">But when I sang of human joy</div>
<div class="verse">A sorrow wrapped each merry face,</div>
<div class="verse">And, Patric! by your beard, they wept,</div>
<div class="verse">Until one came, a tearful boy;</div>
<div class="verse">‘A sadder creature never stept</div>
<div class="verse"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>Than this strange human bard,’ he cried;</div>
<div class="verse">And caught the silver harp away,</div>
<div class="verse">And, weeping over the white strings, hurled</div>
<div class="verse">It down in a leaf-hid hollow place</div>
<div class="verse">That kept dim waters from the sky;</div>
<div class="verse">And each one said with a long, long sigh,</div>
<div class="verse">‘O saddest harp in all the world,</div>
<div class="verse">Sleep there till the moon and the stars die!’</div>
    </div>
    <div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">And now still sad we came to where</div>
<div class="verse">A beautiful young man dreamed within</div>
<div class="verse">A house of wattles, clay, and skin;</div>
<div class="verse">One hand upheld his beardless chin,</div>
<div class="verse">And one a sceptre flashing out</div>
<div class="verse">Wild flames of red and gold and blue,</div>
<div class="verse">Like to a merry wandering rout</div>
<div class="verse">Of dancers leaping in the air;</div>
<div class="verse">And men and maidens knelt them there</div>
<div class="verse">And showed their eyes with teardrops dim,</div>
<div class="verse">And with low murmurs prayed to him,</div>
<div class="verse">And kissed the sceptre with red lips,</div>
<div class="verse">And touched it with their finger-tips.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">He held that flashing sceptre up.</div>
<div class="verse">‘Joy drowns the twilight in the dew,</div>

<div class="verse">And if joy were not on the earth,</div>
<div class="verse">There were an end of change and birth,</div>

<div class="verse">With one long glance on maid and boy</div>
<div class="verse">And the pale blossom of the moon,</div>

<div class="verse">And in a wild and sudden dance</div>

<div class="verse">Among the foamdrops of the sea,</div>
<div class="verse">And there we hushed the revelry;</div>
<div class="verse">And, gathering on our brows a frown,</div>
<div class="verse">Bent all our swaying bodies down,</div>

<div class="verse">That slooping green De Danaan sod</div>
<div class="verse">Sang, ‘God is joy and joy is God,</div>

    <div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">We danced to where in the winding thicket</div>
<div class="verse">The damask roses, bloom on bloom,</div>
<div class="verse">Like crimson meteors hang in the gloom,</div>
<div class="verse">And bending over them softly said,</div>
<div class="verse">Bending over them in the dance,</div>
<div class="verse">With a swift and friendly glance</div>
<div class="verse">From dewy eyes: ‘Upon the dead</div>

<div class="verse">On the dead dim earth encloses:</div>
<div class="verse">But never, never on our graves,</div>
<div class="verse">Heaped beside the glimmering waves,</div>
<div class="verse">Shall fall the leaves of damask roses.</div>
<div class="verse">For neither Death nor Change comes near us,</div>

<div class="verse">And, gathered in a panting band,</div>
<div class="verse">We flung on high each waving hand,</div>

<div class="verse">Of milky brightness to and fro</div>

<h2>THE WANDERINGS OF OISIN</h2>


<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
<div class="verse"><span class="smcap">Now</span>, man of croziers, shadows called our names</div>
<div class="verse">And then away, away, like whirling flames;</div>
<div class="verse">And now fled by, mist-covered, without sound,</div>
<div class="verse">The youth and lady and the deer and hound;</div>
<div class="verse">‘Gaze no more on the phantoms,’ Niamh said,</div>
<div class="verse">And kissed my eyes, and, swaying her bright head</div>
<div class="verse">And her bright body, sang of faery and man</div>
<div class="verse">Before God was or my old line began;</div>
<div class="verse">Wars shadowy, vast, exultant; faeries of old</div>
<div class="verse">Who wedded men with rings of Druid gold;</div>
<div class="verse">And how those lovers never turn their eyes</div>
<div class="verse">Upon the life that fades and flickers and dies,</div>
<div class="verse">But love and kiss on dim shores far away</div>
<div class="verse">Rolled round with music of the sighing spray:</div>
<div class="verse">But sang no more, as when, like a brown bee</div>
<div class="verse">That has drunk full, she crossed the misty sea</div>
<div class="verse">With me in her white arms a hundred years</div>
<div class="verse">Before this day; for now the fall of tears</div>
<div class="verse"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>Troubled her song.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="stanza">
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 9em;">I do not know if days</span></div>
<div class="verse">Or hours passed by, yet hold the morning rays</div>
<div class="verse">Shone many times among the glimmering flowers</div>
<div class="verse">Wove in her flower-like hair, before dark towers</div>
<div class="verse">Rose in the darkness, and the white surf gleamed</div>
<div class="verse">About them; and the horse of faery screamed</div>
<div class="verse">And shivered, knowing the Isle of many Fears,</div>
<div class="verse">Nor ceased until white Niamh stroked his ears</div>
<div class="verse">And named him by sweet names.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="stanza">
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 12em;">A foaming tide</span></div>
<div class="verse">Whitened afar with surge, fan-formed and wide,</div>
<div class="verse">Burst from a great door marred by many a blow</div>
<div class="verse">From mace and sword and pole-axe, long ago</div>
<div class="verse">When gods and giants warred. We rode between</div>
<div class="verse">The seaweed-covered pillars, and the green</div>
<div class="verse">And surging phosphorus alone gave light</div>
<div class="verse">On our dark pathway, till a countless flight</div>
<div class="verse">Of moonlit steps glimmered; and left and right</div>
<div class="verse">Dark statues glimmered over the pale tide</div>
<div class="verse">Upon dark thrones. Between the lids of one</div>
<div class="verse">The imaged meteors had flashed and run</div>
<div class="verse"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>And had disported in the stilly jet,</div>
<div class="verse">And the fixed stars had dawned and shone and set,</div>
<div class="verse">Since God made Time and Death and Sleep: the other</div>
<div class="verse">Stretched his long arm to where, a misty smother,</div>
<div class="verse">The stream churned, churned, and churned—his lips apart,</div>
<div class="verse">As though he told his never slumbering heart</div>
<div class="verse">Of every foamdrop on its misty way:</div>
<div class="verse">Tying the horse to his vast foot that lay</div>
<div class="verse">Half in the unvesselled sea, we climbed the stairs</div>
<div class="verse">And climbed so long, I thought the last steps were</div>
<div class="verse">Hung from the morning star; when these mild words</div>
<div class="verse">Fanned the delighted air like wings of birds:</div>
<div class="verse">‘My brothers spring out of their beds at morn,</div>
<div class="verse">A-murmur like young partridge: with loud horn</div>
<div class="verse">They chase the noon-tide deer;</div>
<div class="verse">And when the dew-drowned stars hang in the air</div>
<div class="verse">Look to long fishing-lines, or point and pare</div>
<div class="verse">A larch-wood hunting spear.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">‘O sigh, O fluttering sigh, be kind to me;</div>
<div class="verse"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>Flutter along the froth lips of the sea,</div>
<div class="verse">And shores the froth lips wet:</div>
<div class="verse">And stay a little while, and bid them weep:</div>
<div class="verse">Ah, touch their blue veined eyelids if they sleep,</div>
<div class="verse">And shake their coverlet.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">‘When you have told how I weep endlessly,</div>
<div class="verse">Flutter along the froth lips of the sea</div>
<div class="verse">And home to me again,</div>
<div class="verse">And in the shadow of my hair lie hid,</div>
<div class="verse">And tell me how you came to one unbid,</div>
<div class="verse">The saddest of all men.’</div>
    </div>
    <div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">A maiden with soft eyes like funeral tapers,</div>
<div class="verse">And face that seemed wrought out of moonlit vapours,</div>
<div class="verse">And a sad mouth, that fear made tremulous</div>
<div class="verse">As any ruddy moth, looked down on us;</div>
<div class="verse">And she with a wave-rusted chain was tied</div>
<div class="verse">To two old eagles, full of ancient pride,</div>
<div class="verse">That with dim eyeballs stood on either side.</div>
<div class="verse">Few feathers were on their dishevelled wings,</div>
<div class="verse">For their dim minds were with the ancient things.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">‘I bring deliverance,’ pearl-pale Niamh said.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">‘Neither the living, nor the unlabouring dead,</div>
<div class="verse"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>Nor the high gods who never lived, may fight</div>
<div class="verse">My enemy and hope; demons for fright</div>
<div class="verse">Jabber and scream about him in the night;</div>
<div class="verse">For he is strong and crafty as the seas</div>
<div class="verse">That sprang under the Seven Hazel Trees.</div>
<div class="verse">And I must needs endure and hate and weep,</div>
<div class="verse">Until the gods and demons drop asleep,</div>
<div class="verse">Hearing Aed touch the mournful strings of gold.’</div>
    </div>
    <div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">‘Is he so dreadful?’</div>
    </div>
    <div class="stanza">
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 9em;">‘Be not over-bold,</span></div>
<div class="verse">But flee while you may flee from him.’</div>
    </div>
    <div class="stanza">
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 17em;">Then I:</span></div>
<div class="verse">‘This demon shall be pierced and drop and die,</div>
<div class="verse">And his loose bulk be thrown in the loud tide.’</div>
    </div>
    <div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">‘Flee from him,’ pearl-pale Niamh weeping cried,</div>
<div class="verse">‘For all men flee the demons’; but moved not,</div>
<div class="verse">Nor shook my firm and spacious soul one jot;</div>
<div class="verse">There was no mightier soul of Heber’s line;</div>
<div class="verse">Now it is old and mouse-like: for a sign</div>
<div class="verse">I burst the chain: still earless, nerveless, blind,</div>
<div class="verse">Wrapped in the things of the unhuman mind,</div>
<div class="verse">In some dim memory or ancient mood</div>
<div class="verse"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>Still earless, nerveless, blind, the eagles stood.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">And then we climbed the stair to a high door,</div>
<div class="verse">A hundred horsemen on the basalt floor</div>
<div class="verse">Beneath had paced content: we held our way</div>
<div class="verse">And stood within: clothed in a misty ray</div>
<div class="verse">I saw a foam-white seagull drift and float</div>
<div class="verse">Under the roof, and with a straining throat</div>
<div class="verse">Shouted, and hailed him: he hung there a star,</div>
<div class="verse">For no man’s cry shall ever mount so far;</div>
<div class="verse">Not even your God could have thrown down that hall;</div>
<div class="verse">Stabling His unloosed lightnings in their stall,</div>
<div class="verse">He had sat down and sighed with cumbered heart,</div>
<div class="verse">As though His hour were come.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="stanza">
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 11em;">We sought the part</span></div>
<div class="verse">That was most distant from the door; green slime</div>
<div class="verse">Made the way slippery, and time on time</div>
<div class="verse">Showed prints of sea-born scales, while down through it</div>
<div class="verse">The captives’ journeys to and fro were writ</div>
<div class="verse">Like a small river, and, where feet touched, came</div>
<div class="verse">A momentary gleam of phosphorus flame.</div>
<div class="verse">Under the deepest shadows of the hall</div>
<div class="verse">That maiden found a ring hung on the wall,</div>
<div class="verse"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>And in the ring a torch, and with its flare</div>
<div class="verse">Making a world about her in the air,</div>
<div class="verse">Passed under a dim doorway, out of sight,</div>
<div class="verse">And came again, holding a second light</div>
<div class="verse">Burning between her fingers, and in mine</div>
<div class="verse">Laid it and sighed: I held a sword whose shine</div>
<div class="verse">No centuries could dim: and a word ran</div>
<div class="verse">Thereon in Ogham letters, ‘Mananan’:</div>
<div class="verse">That sea-god’s name, who in a deep content</div>
<div class="verse">Sprang dripping, and, with captive demons sent</div>
<div class="verse">Out of the seven-fold seas, built the dark hall</div>
<div class="verse">Rooted in foam and clouds, and cried to all</div>
<div class="verse">The mightier masters of a mightier race;</div>
<div class="verse">And at his cry there came no milk-pale face</div>
<div class="verse">Under a crown of thorns and dark with blood,</div>
<div class="verse">But only exultant faces.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="stanza">
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 10em;">Niamh stood</span></div>
<div class="verse">With bowed head, trembling when the white blade shone,</div>
<div class="verse">But she whose hours of tenderness were gone</div>
<div class="verse">Had neither hope nor fear. I bade them hide</div>
<div class="verse">Under the shadows till the tumults died</div>
<div class="verse">Of the loud crashing and earth-shaking fight,</div>
<div class="verse">Lest they should look upon some dreadful sight;</div>
<div class="verse">And thrust the torch between the slimy flags.</div>
<div class="verse">A dome made out of endless carven jags,</div>
<div class="verse">Where shadowy face flowed into shadowy face,</div>
<div class="verse"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>Looked down on me; and in the self-same place</div>
<div class="verse">I waited hour by hour, and the high dome</div>
<div class="verse">Windowless, pillarless, multitudinous home</div>
<div class="verse">Of faces, waited; and the leisured gaze</div>
<div class="verse">Was loaded with the memory of days</div>
<div class="verse">Buried and mighty: when through the great door</div>
<div class="verse">The dawn came in, and glimmered on the floor</div>
<div class="verse">With a pale light, I journeyed round the hall</div>
<div class="verse">And found a door deep sunken in the wall,</div>
<div class="verse">The least of doors; beyond on a dim plain</div>
<div class="verse">A little runnel made a bubbling strain,</div>
<div class="verse">And on the runnel’s stony and bare edge</div>
<div class="verse">A dusky demon dry as a withered sedge</div>
<div class="verse">Swayed, crooning to himself an unknown tongue:</div>
<div class="verse">In a sad revelry he sang and swung</div>
<div class="verse">Bacchant and mournful, passing to and fro</div>
<div class="verse">His hand along the runnel’s side, as though</div>
<div class="verse">The flowers still grew there: far on the sea’s waste;</div>
<div class="verse">Shaking and waving, vapour vapour chased,</div>
<div class="verse">While high frail cloudlets, fed with a green light,</div>
<div class="verse">Like drifts of leaves, immovable and bright,</div>
<div class="verse">Hung in the passionate dawn. He slowly turned:</div>
<div class="verse">A demon’s leisure: eyes, first white, now burned</div>
<div class="verse"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>Like wings of kingfishers; and he arose</div>
<div class="verse">Barking. We trampled up and down with blows</div>
<div class="verse">Of sword and brazen battle-axe, while day</div>
<div class="verse">Gave to high noon and noon to night gave way;</div>
<div class="verse">But when at withering of the sun he knew</div>
<div class="verse">The Druid sword of Mananan, he grew</div>
<div class="verse">To many shapes; I lunged at the smooth throat</div>
<div class="verse">Of a great eel; it changed, and I but smote</div>
<div class="verse">A fir-tree roaring in its leafless top;</div>
<div class="verse">And I but held a corpse, with livid chop</div>
<div class="verse">And dripping and sunken shape, to face and breast,</div>
<div class="verse">When I tore down that tree; but when the west</div>
<div class="verse">Surged up in plumy fire, I lunged and drave</div>
<div class="verse">Through heart and spine, and cast him in the wave,</div>
<div class="verse">Lest Niamh shudder.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="stanza">
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 9em;">Full of hope and dread</span></div>
<div class="verse">Those two came carrying wine and meat and bread,</div>
<div class="verse">And healed my wounds with unguents out of flowers,</div>
<div class="verse">That feed white moths by some De Danaan shrine;</div>
<div class="verse">Then in that hall, lit by the dim sea-shine,</div>
<div class="verse"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>We lay on skins of otters, and drank wine,</div>
<div class="verse">Brewed by the sea-gods, from huge cups that lay</div>
<div class="verse">Upon the lips of sea-gods in their day;</div>
<div class="verse">And then on heaped-up skins of otters slept.</div>
<div class="verse">But when the sun once more in saffron stept,</div>
<div class="verse">Rolling his flagrant wheel out of the deep,</div>
<div class="verse">We sang the loves and angers without sleep,</div>
<div class="verse">And all the exultant labours of the strong:</div>
    </div>
    <div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">But now the lying clerics murder song</div>
<div class="verse">With barren words and flatteries of the weak.</div>
<div class="verse">In what land do the powerless turn the beak</div>
<div class="verse">Of ravening Sorrow, or the hand of Wrath?</div>
<div class="verse">For all your croziers, they have left the path</div>
<div class="verse">And wander in the storms and clinging snows,</div>
<div class="verse">Hopeless for ever: ancient Oisin knows,</div>
<div class="verse">For he is weak and poor and blind, and lies</div>
<div class="verse">On the anvil of the world.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="stanza">
<div class="speakerc">S. PATRIC.</div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 9em;">Be still: the skies</span></div>
<div class="verse">Are choked with thunder, lightning, and fierce wind,</div>
<div class="verse">For God has heard, and speaks His angry mind;</div>
<div class="verse">Go cast your body on the stones and pray,</div>
<div class="verse">For He has wrought midnight and dawn and day.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span></div>
    </div>
    <div class="stanza">
<div class="speakerc">OISIN.</div>
<div class="verse">Saint, do you weep? I hear amid the thunder</div>
<div class="verse">The Fenian horses; armour torn asunder;</div>
<div class="verse">Laughter and cries: the armies clash and shock;</div>
<div class="verse">All is done now; I see the ravens flock;</div>
<div class="verse">Ah, cease, you mournful, laughing Fenian horn!</div>
    </div>
    <div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">We feasted for three days. On the fourth morn</div>
<div class="verse">I found, dropping sea-foam on the wide stair,</div>
<div class="verse">And hung with slime, and whispering in his hair,</div>
<div class="verse">That demon dull and unsubduable;</div>
<div class="verse">And once more to a day-long battle fell,</div>
<div class="verse">And at the sundown threw him in the surge,</div>
<div class="verse">To lie until the fourth morn saw emerge</div>
<div class="verse">His new healed shape: and for a hundred years</div>
<div class="verse">So warred, so feasted, with nor dreams, nor fears</div>
<div class="verse">Nor languor nor fatigue: an endless feast,</div>
<div class="verse">An endless war.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="stanza">
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 7em;">The hundred years had ceased;</span></div>
<div class="verse">I stood upon the stair: the surges bore</div>
<div class="verse">A beech bough to me, and my heart grew sore,</div>
<div class="verse">Remembering how I stood by white-haired Finn</div>
<div class="verse">While the woodpecker made a merry din,</div>
<div class="verse"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>The hare leaped in the grass.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="stanza">
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 12em;">Young Niamh came</span></div>
<div class="verse">Holding that horse, and sadly called my name;</div>
<div class="verse">I mounted, and we passed over the lone</div>
<div class="verse">And drifting grayness, while this monotone,</div>
<div class="verse">Surly and distant, mixed inseparably</div>
<div class="verse">Into the clangour of the wind and sea:</div>
    </div>
    <div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">‘I hear my soul drop down into decay,</div>
<div class="verse">And Mananan’s dark tower, stone by stone,</div>
<div class="verse">Gather sea-slime and fall the seaward way,</div>
<div class="verse">And the moon goad the waters night and day,</div>
<div class="verse">That all be overthrown.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">‘But till the moon has taken all, I wage</div>
<div class="verse">War on the mightiest men under the skies,</div>
<div class="verse">And they have fallen or fled, age after age:</div>
<div class="verse">Light is man’s love, and lighter is man’s rage;</div>
<div class="verse">His purpose drifts and dies.’</div>
    </div>
    <div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">And then lost Niamh murmured, ‘Love, we go</div>
<div class="verse">To the Island of Forgetfulness, for lo!</div>
<div class="verse">The Islands of Dancing and of Victories</div>
<div class="verse">Are empty of all power.’</div>
    </div>
    <div class="stanza">
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 11em;">‘And which of these</span></div>
<div class="verse">Is the Island of Content?’</div>
    </div>
    <div class="stanza">
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 9em;">‘None know,’ she said;</span></div>
<div class="verse">And on my bosom laid her weeping head.</div>

<h2>THE WANDERINGS OF OISIN</h2>


<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
<div class="verse"><span class="smcap">Fled</span> foam underneath us, and round us, a wandering and milky smoke,</div>
<div class="verse">High as the saddle girth, covering away from our glances the tide;</div>
<div class="verse">And those that fled, and that followed, from the foam-pale distance broke;</div>
<div class="verse">The immortal desire of immortals we saw in their faces, and sighed.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">I mused on the chase with the Fenians, and Bran, Sgeolan, Lomair,</div>
<div class="verse">And never a song sang Niamh, and over my finger-tips</div>
<div class="verse">Came now the sliding of tears and sweeping of mist-cold air,</div>
<div class="verse">And now the warmth of sighs, and after the quiver of lips.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Were we days long or hours long in riding, when rolled in a grisly peace,</div>
<div class="verse"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>An isle lay level before us, with dripping hazel and oak?</div>
<div class="verse">And we stood on a sea’s edge we saw not; for whiter than new-washed fleece</div>
<div class="verse">Fled foam underneath us, and round us, a wandering and milky smoke.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">And we rode on the plains of the sea’s edge; the sea’s edge barren and gray,</div>
<div class="verse">Gray sand on the green of the grasses and over the dripping trees,</div>
<div class="verse">Dripping and doubling landward, as though they would hasten away</div>
<div class="verse">Like an army of old men longing for rest from the moan of the seas.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">But the trees grew taller and closer, immense in their wrinkling bark;</div>
<div class="verse">Dropping; a murmurous dropping; old silence and that one sound;</div>
<div class="verse">For no live creatures lived there, no weasels moved in the dark:</div>
<div class="verse">Long sighs arose in our spirits, beneath us bubbled the ground.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">And the ears of the horse went sinking away in the hollow night,</div>
<div class="verse">For, as drift from a sailor slow drowning the gleams of the world and the sun,</div>
<div class="verse"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>Ceased on our hands and our faces, on hazel and oak leaf, the light,</div>
<div class="verse">And the stars were blotted above us, and the whole of the world was one.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Till the horse gave a whinny; for, cumbrous with stems of the hazel and oak,</div>
<div class="verse">A valley flowed down from his hoofs, and there in the long grass lay,</div>
<div class="verse">Under the starlight and shadow, a monstrous slumbering folk,</div>
<div class="verse">Their naked and gleaming bodies poured out and heaped in the way.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">And by them were arrow and war-axe, arrow and shield and blade;</div>
<div class="verse">And dew-blanched horns, in whose hollow a child of three years old</div>
<div class="verse">Could sleep on a bed of rushes, and all inwrought and inlaid,</div>
<div class="verse">And more comely than man can make them with bronze and silver and gold.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">And each of the huge white creatures was huger than four-score men;</div>
<div class="verse">The tops of their ears were feathered, their hands were the claws of birds,</div>
<div class="verse">And, shaking the plumes of the grasses and the leaves of the mural glen,</div>
<div class="verse"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>The breathing came from those bodies, long-warless, grown whiter than curds.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">The wood was so spacious above them, that He who had stars for His flocks</div>
<div class="verse">Could fondle the leaves with His fingers, nor go from His dew-cumbered skies;</div>
<div class="verse">So long were they sleeping, the owls had builded their nests in their locks,</div>
<div class="verse">Filling the fibrous dimness with long generations of eyes.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">And over the limbs and the valley the slow owls wandered and came,</div>
<div class="verse">Now in a place of star-fire, and now in a shadow place wide;</div>
<div class="verse">And the chief of the huge white creatures, his knees in the soft star-flame,</div>

    </div>
    <div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Golden the nails of his bird-claws, flung loosely along the dim ground;</div>
<div class="verse">In one was a branch soft-shining, with bells more many than sighs,</div>
<div class="verse">In midst of an old man’s bosom; owls ruffling and pacing around,</div>

<div class="verse">And there at the foot of the mountain, two carried a sack full of sand,</div>

<h3>THE WIND AMONG THE REEDS.</h3>


<p>When I wrote these poems I had so meditated over the
images that came to me in writing ‘Ballads and Lyrics,’
‘The Rose,’ and ‘The Wanderings of Oisin,’ and other
images from Irish folk-lore, that they had become true
symbols. I had sometimes when awake, but more often
in sleep, moments of vision, a state very unlike dreaming,
when these images took upon themselves what seemed an
independent life and became a part of a mystic language,
which seemed always as if it would bring me some strange
revelation. Being troubled at what was thought a reckless
obscurity, I tried to explain myself in lengthy notes, into
which I put all the little learning I had, and more wilful
phantasy than I now think admirable, though what is most
mystical still seems to me the most true. I quote in what
follows the better or the more necessary passages.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">The Hosting of the Sidhe</span> (<a href="#Page_3">page 3</a>).</h4>

<p>The gods of ancient Ireland, the Tuatha De Danaan, or
the Tribes of the goddess Danu, or the Sidhe, from Aes
Sidhe, or Sluagh Sidhe, the people of the Faery Hills, as these
words are usually explained, still ride the country as of old.
Sidhe is also Gaelic for wind, and certainly the Sidhe have
much to do with the wind. They journey in whirling
winds, the winds that were called the dance of the daughters<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
of Herodias in the Middle Ages, Herodias doubtless taking
the place of some old goddess. When the country people
see the leaves whirling on the road they bless themselves,
because they believe the Sidhe to be passing by. They are
almost always said to wear no covering upon their heads, and
to let their hair stream out; and the great among them, for
they have great and simple, go much upon horseback. If
any one becomes too much interested in them, and sees them
overmuch, he loses all interest in ordinary things.</p>

<p>A woman near Gort, in Galway, says: ‘There is a boy,
now, of the Clorans; but I wouldn’t for the world let them
think I spoke of him; it’s two years since he came from
America, and since that time he never went to Mass, or to
church, or to fairs, or to market, or to stand on the cross
roads, or to hurling, or to nothing. And if any one comes
into the house, it’s into the room he’ll slip, not to see them;
and as to work, he has the garden dug to bits, and the whole
place smeared with cow dung; and such a crop as was never
seen; and the alders all plaited till they look grand. One
day he went as far as the chapel; but as soon as he got to
the door he turned straight round again, as if he hadn’t
power to pass it. I wonder he wouldn’t get the priest to
read a Mass for him, or something; but the crop he has is
grand, and you may know well he has some to help him.’
One hears many stories of the kind; and a man whose son is
believed to go out riding among them at night tells me that
he is careless about everything, and lies in bed until it is late
in the day. A doctor believes this boy to be mad. Those
that are at times ‘away,’ as it is called, know all things, but
are afraid to speak. A countryman at Kiltartan says, ‘There
was one of the Lydons—John—was away for seven years,
lying in his bed, but brought away at nights, and he knew
everything; and one, Kearney, up in the mountains, a cousin
of his own, lost two hoggets, and came and told him, and he
knew the very spot where they were, and told him, and he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
got them back again. But <i>they</i> were vexed at that, and took
away the power, so that he never knew anything again, no
more than another.’</p>

<p>Knocknarea is in Sligo, and the country people say that
Maeve, still a great queen of the western Sidhe, is buried in
the cairn of stones upon it. I have written of Clooth-na-Bare
in ‘The Celtic Twilight.’ She ‘went all over the
world, seeking a lake deep enough to drown her faery life,
of which she had grown weary, leaping from hill to hill, and
setting up a cairn of stones wherever her feet lighted, until,
at last, she found the deepest water in the world in little
Lough Ia, on the top of the bird mountain, in Sligo.’ I
forget, now, where I heard this story, but it may have been
from a priest at Collooney. Clooth-na-Bare would mean
the old woman of Bare, but is evidently a corruption of
Cailleac Bare, the old woman of Bare, who, under the names
Bare, and Berah, and Beri, and Verah, and Dera, and Dhira,
appears in the legends of many places. Mr. O’Grady found
her haunting Lough Liath high up on the top of a mountain
of the Fews, the Slieve Fuadh, or Slieve G-Cullain of
old times, under the name of the Cailleac Buillia. He
describes Lough Liath as a desolate moon-shaped lake, with
made wells and sunken passages upon its borders, and beset
by marsh and heather and gray boulders, and closes his
‘Flight of the Eagle’ with a long rhapsody upon mountain
and lake, because of the heroic tales and beautiful old myths
that have hung about them always. He identifies the Cailleac
Buillia with that Meluchra who persuaded Fionn to go
to her amid the waters of Lough Liath, and so changed him
with her enchantments, that, though she had to free him
because of the threats of the Fiana, his hair was ever afterwards
as white as snow. To this day the Tuatha De
Danaan that are in the waters beckon to men, and drown
them in the waters; and Bare, or Dhira, or Meluchra, or
whatever name one likes the best, is, doubtless, the name of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
a mistress among them. Meluchra was daughter of Cullain;
and Cullain Mr. O’Grady calls, upon I know not what
authority, a form of Lir, the master of waters. The people
of the waters have been in all ages beautiful and changeable
and lascivious, or beautiful and wise and lonely, for water is
everywhere the signature of the fruitfulness of the body and
of the fruitfulness of dreams. The white hair of Fionn may
be but another of the troubles of those that come to unearthly
wisdom and earthly trouble, and the threats and violence of
the Fiana against her, a different form of the threats and
violence the country people use, to make the Aes Sidhe
give up those that are ‘away.’ Bare is now often called
an ugly old woman, but in the ‘Song of Bare,’ which
Lady Gregory has given in her ‘Saints and Wonders,’
she laments her lost beauty after the withering of seven
hundred years; and Dr. Joyce says that one of her old
names was Aebhin, which means beautiful. Aebhin was
the goddess of the tribes of northern Leinster; and the lover
she had made immortal, and who loved her perfectly, left
her, and put on mortality, to fight among them against the
stranger, and died on the strand of Clontarf.</p>

<p>The Rose has been for many centuries a symbol of spiritual
love and supreme beauty. The lotus was in some Eastern
countries imagined blossoming upon the Tree of Life, as
the Flower of Life, and is thus represented in Assyrian bas-reliefs.
Because the Rose, the flower sacred to the Virgin
Mary, and the flower that Apuleius’ adventurer ate, when
he was changed out of the ass’s shape and received into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
fellowship of Isis, is the western Flower of Life, I have
imagined it growing upon the Tree of Life. I once stood
beside a man in Ireland when he saw it growing there in a
vision, that seemed to have rapt him out of his body. He
saw the Garden of Eden walled about, and on the top of a
high mountain, as in certain mediæval diagrams, and after
passing the Tree of Knowledge, on which grew fruit full of
troubled faces, and through whose branches flowed, he was
told, sap that was human souls, he came to a tall, dark tree,
with little bitter fruits, and was shown a kind of stair or
ladder going up through the tree, and told to go up; and
near the top of the tree, a beautiful woman, like the Goddess
of Life, associated with the tree in Assyria, gave him a rose
that seemed to have been growing upon the tree. One finds
the Rose in the Irish poets, sometimes as a religious symbol,
as in the phrase, ‘the Rose of Friday,’ meaning the Rose of
austerity, in a Gaelic poem in Dr. Hyde’s ‘Religious Songs
of Connacht’; and, I think, as a symbol of woman’s beauty
in the Gaelic song, ‘Roseen Dubh’; and a symbol of Ireland
in Mangan’s adaptation of ‘Roseen Dubh,’ ‘My Dark
Rosaleen,’ and in Mr. Aubrey de Vere’s ‘The Little Black
Rose.’ I do not know any evidence to prove whether this
symbol came to Ireland with mediæval Christianity, or
whether it has come down from older times. I have read
somewhere that a stone engraved with a Celtic god, who
holds what looks like a rose in one hand, has been found
somewhere in England; but I cannot find the reference,
though I certainly made a note of it. If the Rose was
really a symbol of Ireland among the Gaelic poets, and if
‘Roseen Dubh’ is really a political poem, as some think, one
may feel pretty certain that the ancient Celts associated the
Rose with Eire, or Fotla, or Banba—goddesses who gave
their names to Ireland—or with some principal god or goddess,
for such symbols are not suddenly adopted or invented,
but come out of mythology.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span></p>

<p>I have made the Seven Lights, the constellation of the
Bear, lament for the theft of the Rose, and I have made the
Dragon, the constellation Draco, the guardian of the Rose,
because these constellations move about the pole of the
heavens, the ancient Tree of Life in many countries, and
are often associated with the Tree of Life in mythology. It
is this Tree of Life that I have put into the ‘Song of Mongan’
under its common Irish form of a hazel; and, because
it had sometimes the stars for fruit, I have hung upon it ‘the
Crooked Plough’ and the ‘Pilot Star,’ as Gaelic-speaking
Irishmen sometimes call the Bear and the North star. I
have made it an axle-tree in ‘Aedh hears the Cry of the
Sedge,’ for this was another ancient way of representing it.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">The Host of the Air</span> (<a href="#Page_6">p. 6</a>).</h4>

<p>Some writers distinguish between the Sluagh Gaoith, the
host of the air, and Sluagh Sidhe, the host of the Sidhe, and
describe the host of the air as of a peculiar malignancy. Dr.
Joyce says, ‘Of all the different kinds of goblins .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. air
demons were most dreaded by the people. They lived
among clouds, and mists, and rocks, and hated the human
race with the utmost malignity.’ A very old Aran charm,
which contains the words ‘Send God, by his strength, between
us and the host of the Sidhe, between us and the host
of the air,’ seems also to distinguish among them. I am
inclined, however, to think that the distinction came in
with Christianity and its belief about the prince of the air,
for the host of the Sidhe, as I have already explained, are
closely associated with the wind.</p>

<p>They are said to steal brides just after their marriage, and
sometimes in a blast of wind. A man in Galway says, ‘At
Aughanish there were two couples came to the shore to be
married, and one of the newly married women was in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
boat with the priest, and they going back to the island; and
a sudden blast of wind came, and the priest said some blessed
words that were able to save himself, but the girl was
swept.’</p>

<p>This woman was drowned; but more often the persons
who are taken ‘get the touch,’ as it is called, and fall into a
half dream, and grow indifferent to all things, for their true
life has gone out of the world, and is among the hills and
the forts of the Sidhe. A faery doctor has told me that his
wife ‘got the touch’ at her marriage because there was one
of them wanted her; and the way he knew for certain was,
that when he took a pitchfork out of the rafters, and told
her it was a broom, she said, ‘It is a broom.’ She was, the
truth is, in the magical sleep, to which people have given a
new name lately, that makes the imagination so passive that
it can be moulded by any voice in any world into any shape.
A mere likeness of some old woman, or even old animal,
some one or some thing the Sidhe have no longer a use
for, is believed to be left instead of the person who is
‘away’; this some one or some thing can, it is thought, be
driven away by threats, or by violence (though I have heard
country women say that violence is wrong), which perhaps
awakes the soul out of the magical sleep. The story in the
poem is founded on an old Gaelic ballad that was sung and
translated for me by a woman at Ballisodare in County
Sligo; but in the ballad the husband found the keeners
keening his wife when he got to his house. She was ‘swept’
at once; but the Sidhe are said to value those the most whom
they but cast into a half dream, which may last for years,
for they need the help of a living person in most of the
things they do. There are many stories of people who seem
to die and be buried—though the country people will tell
you it is but some one or some thing put in their place that
dies and is buried—and yet are brought back afterwards.
These tales are perhaps memories of true awakenings out of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
the magical sleep, moulded by the imagination, under the
influence of a mystical doctrine which it understands too
literally, into the shape of some well-known traditional tale.
One does not hear them as one hears the others, from the
persons who are ‘away,’ or from their wives or husbands;
and one old man, who had often seen the Sidhe, began one
of them with ‘Maybe it is all vanity.’</p>

<p>Here is a tale that a friend of mine heard in the Burren
hills, and it is a type of all:—</p>

<p>‘There was a girl to be married, and she didn’t like the
man, and she cried when the day was coming, and said she
wouldn’t go along with him. And the mother said, “Get
into the bed, then, and I’ll say that you’re sick.” And so
she did. And when the man came the mother said to him,
“You can’t get her, she’s sick in the bed.” And he looked
in and said, “That’s not my wife that’s in the bed, it’s some
old hag.” And the mother began to cry and roar. And he
went out and got two hampers of turf, and made a fire, that
they thought he was going to burn the house down. And
when the fire was kindled, “Come out, now,” says he, “and
we’ll see who you are, when I’ll put you on the fire.” And
when she heard that, she gave one leap, and was out of the
house, and they saw, then, it was an old hag she was. Well,
the man asked the advice of an old woman, and she bid him
go to a faery-bush that was near, and he might get some
word of her. So he went there at night, and saw all sorts
of grand people, and they in carriages or riding on horses,
and among them he could see the girl he came to look for.
So he went again to the old woman, and she said, “If you can
get the three bits of blackthorn out of her hair, you’ll get her
again.” So that night he went again, and that time he only
got hold of a bit of her hair. But the old woman told him
that was no use, and that he was put back now, and it might
be twelve nights before he’d get her. But on the fourth
night he got the third bit of blackthorn, and he took her,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
and she came away with him. He never told the mother he
had got her; but one day she saw her at a fair, and, says
she, “That’s my daughter; I know her by the smile and by
the laugh of her, and she with a shawl about her head.” So
the husband said, “You’re right there, and hard I worked to
get her.” She spoke often of the grand things she saw
underground, and how she used to have wine to drink, and
to drive out in a carriage with four horses every night. And
she used to be able to see her husband when he came to look
for her, and she was greatly afraid he’d get a drop of the
wine, for then he would have come underground and never
left it again. And she was glad herself to come to earth
again, and not to be left there.’</p>

<p>The old Gaelic literature is full of the appeals of the
Tuatha De Danaan to mortals whom they would bring
into their country; but the song of Midher to the beautiful
Etain, the wife of the king who was called Echaid the
ploughman, is the type of all.</p>

<p>‘O beautiful woman, come with me to the marvellous
land where one listens to a sweet music, where one has
spring flowers in one’s hair, where the body is like snow
from head to foot, where no one is sad or silent, where
teeth are white and eyebrows are black .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. cheeks red like
foxglove in flower.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Ireland is beautiful, but not so
beautiful as the Great Plain I call you to. The beer of
Ireland is heady, but the beer of the Great Plain is much
more heady. How marvellous is the country I am speaking
of! Youth does not grow old there. Streams with warm
flood flow there; sometimes mead, sometimes wine. Men
are charming and without a blot there, and love is not forbidden
there. O woman, when you come into my powerful
country you will wear a crown of gold upon your head.
I will give you the flesh of swine, and you will have beer
and milk to drink, O beautiful woman. O beautiful
woman, come with me!’<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span></p>


<h4><span class="smcap">The Song of Wandering Aengus</span> (<a href="#Page_11">p. 11</a>).</h4>

<p>The Tuatha De Danaan can take all shapes, and those
that are in the waters take often the shape of fish. A woman
of Burren, in Galway, says, ‘There are more of them in
the sea than on the land, and they sometimes try to come
over the side of the boat in the form of fishes, for they can
take their choice shape.’ At other times they are beautiful
women; and another Galway woman says, ‘Surely those
things are in the sea as well as on land. My father was out
fishing one night off Tyrone. And something came beside
the boat that had eyes shining like candles. And then a
wave came in, and a storm rose all in a minute, and whatever
was in the wave, the weight of it had like to sink the
boat. And then they saw that it was a woman in the sea
that had the shining eyes. So my father went to the priest,
and he bid him always to take a drop of holy water and
a pinch of salt out in the boat with him, and nothing could
harm him.’</p>

<p>The poem was suggested to me by a Greek folk song;
but the folk belief of Greece is very like that of Ireland, and
I certainly thought, when I wrote it, of Ireland, and of the
spirits that are in Ireland. An old man who was cutting a
quickset hedge near Gort, in Galway, said, only the other
day, ‘One time I was cutting timber over in Inchy, and
about eight o’clock one morning, when I got there, I saw
a girl picking nuts, with her hair hanging down over her
shoulders; brown hair; and she had a good, clean face, and
she was tall, and nothing on her head, and her dress no way
gaudy, but simple. And when she felt me coming she
gathered herself up, and was gone, as if the earth had swallowed
her up. And I followed her, and looked for her, but
I never could see her again from that day to this, never again.’</p>

<p>The county Galway people use the word ‘clean’ in its
old sense of fresh and comely.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span></p>


<h4><span class="smcap">He Mourns for the Change that has Come upon
Him and His Beloved, and Longs for the End of
the World</span> (<a href="#Page_15">p. 15</a>).</h4>

<p>My deer and hound are properly related to the deer and
hound that flicker in and out of the various tellings of the
Arthurian legends, leading different knights upon adventures,
and to the hounds and to the hornless deer at the
beginning of, I think, all tellings of Oisin’s journey to the
country of the young. The hound is certainly related to
the Hounds of Annwvyn or of Hades, who are white, and
have red ears, and were heard, and are, perhaps, still heard
by Welsh peasants, following some flying thing in the night
winds; and is probably related to the hounds that Irish
country people believe will awake and seize the souls of the
dead if you lament them too loudly or too soon. An old
woman told a friend and myself that she saw what she
thought were white birds, flying over an enchanted place;
but found, when she got near, that they had dogs’ heads,
and I do not doubt that my hound and these dog-headed
birds are of the same family. I got my hound and deer out
of a last century Gaelic poem about Oisin’s journey to the
country of the young. After the hunting of the hornless
deer, that leads him to the seashore, and while he is riding
over the sea with Niamh, he sees amid the waters—I have
not the Gaelic poem by me, and describe it from memory—a
young man following a girl who has a golden apple, and
afterwards a hound with one red ear following a deer with
no horns. This hound and this deer seem plain images of
the desire of man ‘which is for the woman,’ and ‘the desire
of the woman which is for the desire of the man,’ and of
all desires that are as these. I have read them in this way in
‘The Wanderings of Usheen’ or Oisin, and have made my
lover sigh because he has seen in their faces ‘the immortal
desire of immortals.’<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span></p>

<p>The man in my poem who has a hazel wand may have
been Aengus, Master of Love; and I have made the boar
without bristles come out of the West, because the place of
sunset was in Ireland, as in other countries, a place of symbolic
darkness and death.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">The Cap and Bells</span> (<a href="#Page_22">p. 22</a>).</h4>

<p>I dreamed this story exactly as I have written it, and
dreamed another long dream after it, trying to make out
its meaning, and whether I was to write it in prose or
verse. The first dream was more a vision than a dream, for
it was beautiful and coherent, and gave me the sense of
illumination and exaltation that one gets from visions, while
the second dream was confused and meaningless. The poem
has always meant a great deal to me, though, as is the way
with symbolic poems, it has not always meant quite the same
thing. Blake would have said, ‘the authors are in eternity,’
and I am quite sure they can only be questioned in dreams.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">The Valley of the Black Pig</span> (<a href="#Page_24">p. 24</a>).</h4>

<p>All over Ireland there are prophecies of the coming rout
of the enemies of Ireland, in a certain Valley of the Black
Pig, and these prophecies are, no doubt, now, as they were
in the Fenian days, a political force. I have heard of one
man who would not give any money to the Land League,
because the Battle could not be until the close of the century;
but, as a rule, periods of trouble bring prophecies of
its near coming. A few years before my time, an old man
who lived at Lisadill, in Sligo, used to fall down in a fit
and rave out descriptions of the Battle; and a man in Sligo
has told me that it will be so great a battle that the horses<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
shall go up to their fetlocks in blood, and that their girths,
when it is over, will rot from their bellies for lack of a hand
to unbuckle them. If one reads Professor Rhys’ “Celtic
Heathendom” by the light of Professor Frazer’s “Golden
Bough,” and puts together what one finds there about the
boar that killed Diarmuid, and other old Celtic boars and
sows, one sees that the battle is mythological, and that the
Pig it is named from must be a type of cold and winter doing
battle with the summer, or of death battling with life. For
the purposes of poetry, at any rate, I think it a symbol of the
darkness that will destroy the world. The country people
say there is no shape for a spirit to take so dangerous as the
shape of a pig; and a Galway blacksmith—and blacksmiths
are thought to be specially protected—says he would be
afraid to meet a pig on the road at night; and another Galway
man tells this story: ‘There was a man coming the
road from Gort to Garryland one night, and he had a drop
taken; and before him, on the road, he saw a pig walking;
and having a drop in, he gave a shout, and made a kick at it,
and bid it get out of that. And by the time he got home,
his arm was swelled from the shoulder to be as big as a bag,
and he couldn’t use his hand with the pain of it. And his
wife brought him, after a few days, to a woman that used to
do cures at Rahasane. And on the road all she could do
would hardly keep him from lying down to sleep on the
grass. And when they got to the woman she knew all that
happened; “and,” says she, “it’s well for you that your wife
didn’t let you fall asleep on the grass, for if you had done
that but even for one instant, you’d be a lost man.”’</p>

<p>Professor Rhys, who considers the bristleless boar a symbol
of darkness and cold, rather than of winter and cold, thinks
it was without bristles because the darkness is shorn away by
the sun.</p>

<p>The Battle should, I believe, be compared with three
other battles; a battle the Sidhe are said to fight when a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
person is being taken away by them; a battle they are said
to fight in November for the harvest; the great battle the
Tuatha De Danaan fought, according to the Gaelic chroniclers,
with the Fomor at Moy Tura, or the Towery Plain.</p>

<p>I have heard of the battle over the dying both in County
Galway and in the Isles of Aran, an old Aran fisherman
having told me that it was fought over two of his children,
and that he found blood in a box he had for keeping fish,
when it was over; and I have written about it, and given
examples elsewhere. A faery doctor, on the borders of
Galway and Clare, explained it as a battle between the
friends and enemies of the dying, the one party trying to
take them, the other trying to save them from being taken.
It may once, when the land of the Sidhe was the only other
world, and when every man who died was carried thither,
have always accompanied death. I suggest that the battle
between the Tuatha De Danaan, the powers of light, and
warmth, and fruitfulness, and goodness, and the Fomor, the
powers of darkness, and cold, and barrenness, and badness
upon the Towery Plain, was the establishment of the habitable
world, the rout of the ancestral darkness; that the battle
among the Sidhe for the harvest is the annual battle of
summer and winter; that the battle among the Sidhe at a
man’s death is the battle of life and death; and that the
battle of the Black Pig is the battle between the manifest
world and the ancestral darkness at the end of all things; and
that all these battles are one, the battle of all things with
shadowy decay. Once a symbolism has possessed the imagination
of large numbers of men, it becomes, as I believe, an
embodiment of disembodied powers, and repeats itself in
dreams and visions, age after age.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span></p>


<h4><span class="smcap">The Secret Rose</span> (<a href="#Page_32">p. 32</a>).</h4>

<p>I find that I have unintentionally changed the old story
of Conchubar’s death. He did not see the crucifixion in a
vision, but was told about it. He had been struck by a ball,
made of the dried brain of a dead enemy, and hurled out of
a sling; and this ball had been left in his head, and his head
had been mended, the ‘Book of Leinster’ says, with thread
of gold because his hair was like gold. Keating, a writer of
the time of Elizabeth, says, ‘In that state did he remain
seven years, until the Friday on which Christ was crucified,
according to some historians; and when he saw the unusual
changes of the creation and the eclipse of the sun and the
moon at its full, he asked of Bucrach, a Leinster Druid, who
was along with him, what was it that brought that unusual
change upon the planets of Heaven and Earth. “Jesus
Christ, the Son of God,” said the Druid, “who is now being
crucified by the Jews.” “That is a pity,” said Conchubar;
“were I in his presence I would kill those who were putting
him to death.” And with that he brought out his sword,
and rushed at a woody grove which was convenient to him,
and began to cut and fell it; and what he said was, that if he
were among the Jews, that was the usage he would give
them, and from the excessiveness of his fury which seized
upon him, the ball started out of his head, and some of the
brain came after it, and in that way he died. The wood of
Lanshraigh, in Feara Rois, is the name by which that
shrubby wood is called.’</p>

<p>I have imagined Cuchulain meeting Fand ‘walking among
flaming dew.’ The story of their love is one of the most
beautiful of our old tales.</p>

<p>I have founded the man ‘who drove the gods out of their
Liss,’ or fort, upon something I have read about Caolte after
the battle of Gabra, when almost all his companions were
killed, driving the gods out of their Liss, either at Osraighe,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
now Ossory, or at Eas Ruaidh, now Asseroe, a waterfall at
Ballyshannon, where Ilbreac, one of the children of the
goddess Danu, had a Liss. But maybe I only read it in
Mr. Standish O’Grady, who has a fine imagination, for I
find no such story in Lady Gregory’s book.</p>

<p>I have founded ‘the proud dreaming king’ upon Fergus,
the son of Roigh, the legendary poet of ‘the quest of the
bull of Cuailgne,’ as he is in the ancient story of Deirdre, and
in modern poems by Ferguson. He married Nessa, and
Ferguson makes him tell how she took him ‘captive in a
single look.’</p>

<div class="verse">Far from life and passion laid;</div>

</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Presently, because of his great love, he gave up his throne
to Conchubar, her son by another, and lived out his days
feasting, and fighting, and hunting. His promise never to
refuse a feast from a certain comrade, and the mischief that
came by his promise, and the vengeance he took afterwards,
are a principal theme of the poets. I have explained my
changing imaginations of him in ‘Fergus and the Druid,’ and
in a little song in the second act of ‘The Countess Kathleen,’
and in ‘Deirdre.’</p>

<p>I have founded him ‘who sold tillage, and house, and
goods,’ upon something in ‘The Red Pony,’ a folk tale in
Mr. Larminie’s ‘West Irish Folk Tales.’ A young man
‘saw a light before him on the high road. When he came
as far, there was an open box on the road, and a light coming
up out of it. He took up the box. There was a lock of
hair in it. Presently he had to go to become the servant of
a king for his living. There were eleven boys. When they
were going out into the stable at ten o’clock, each of them
took a light but he. He took no candle at all with him.
Each of them went into his own stable. When he went<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
into his stable he opened the box. He left it in a hole in
the wall. The light was great. It was twice as much as
in the other stables.’ The king hears of it, and makes him
show him the box. The king says, ‘You must go and bring
me the woman to whom the hair belongs.’ In the end, the
young man, and not the king, marries the woman.</p>

<h3>EARLY POEMS:</h3>


<h4><span class="smcap">Ballads and Lyrics</span> (<a href="#Page_89">p. 89</a>). ‘<span class="smcap">The Rose</span>’ (<a href="#Page_139">p. 139</a>).
‘<span class="smcap">The Wanderings of Oisin</span>’ (<a href="#Page_175">p. 175</a>).</h4>

<p>When I first wrote I went here and there for my subjects
as my reading led me, and preferred to all other countries
Arcadia and the India of romance, but presently I convinced
myself, for such reasons as those in ‘Ireland and the Arts,’ that
I should never go for the scenery of a poem to any country
but my own, and I think that I shall hold to that conviction
to the end. I was very young; and, perhaps because I belonged
to a Young Ireland Society in Dublin, I wished to be as
easily understood as the Young Ireland writers, to write
always out of the common thought of the people.</p>

<p>I have put the poems written while I was influenced by
this desire, though with an always lessening force, into those
sections which I have called ‘Early Poems.’ I read certain
of them now with no little discontent, for I find, especially
in the ballads, some triviality and sentimentality. Mangan
and Davis, at their best, are not sentimental and trivial, but
I became so from an imitation that was not natural to me.
When I was writing the poems in the second of the three, the
section called ‘The Rose,’ I found that I was becoming unintelligible
to the young men who had been in my thought.
We have still the same tradition, but I have been like a
traveller who, having when newly arrived in the city noticed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
nothing but the news of the market-place, the songs of the
workmen, the great public buildings, has come after certain
months to let his thoughts run upon some little carving in
its niche, some Ogham on a stone, or the conversation of a
countryman who knows more of the ‘Boar without Bristles’
than of the daily paper.</p>

<p>When writing I went for nearly all my subjects to Irish
folklore and legends, much as a Young Ireland poet would
have done, writing ‘Down by the Salley Garden’ by adding
a few lines to a couple of lines I heard sung at Ballisodare;
‘The Meditation of the Old Fisherman’ from the words
of a not very old fisherman at Rosses Point; ‘The Lamentation
of the Old Pensioner’ from words spoken by a man
on the Two Rock Mountain to a friend of mine; ‘The
Ballad of the Old Foxhunter’ from an incident in one of
Kickham’s novels; and ‘The Ballad of Moll Magee’ from
a sermon preached in a chapel at Howth; and ‘The Wanderings
of Oisin’ from a Gaelic poem of the Eighteenth Century
and certain Middle Irish poems in dialogue. It is no
longer necessary to say who Oisin and Cuchulain and Fergus
